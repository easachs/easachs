# Hey there!

My name is Eli and I am a language learner, music lover, environmentalist, enthusiastic collaborator, 6th grade Spelling Bee champion, aspiring paella chef, teacher, student, gardener and Peace Corps dropout.

Before diving into software development, I worked as an educator and environmental services professional both in the Denver area and abroad. Currently, I am focused on using object oriented programming, test driven development, agile workflows, and the Ruby on Rails framework to create and execute robust and thoughtfully-designed web applications. When Iâ€™m not at the computer, you can find me outdoors, learning a new skill, or spending time with friends and family.
