# Oh hey

My name is Eli, and I am an environmentalist, music lover, collaborator, language learner, 6th grade Spelling Bee champion, aspiring paella chef, teacher, student, gardener and Peace Corps dropout. Before diving into software development, I worked as an educator and environmental services professional both in the Denver area and abroad. When I’m not at the computer, you can find me outdoors, learning a new skill, or spending time with friends and family.
